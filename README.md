=====================

Eventually I will fill this out and add something that isn't in a private repo but for the meantime here is some boring history about me.


## About Me

I am a web developer.  I don’t really find the time to update this so this will be a long work in progress.

I have been concentrating on Front-End Development and have been using various full stack development setups – LAMP, Sass, some Node.JS and other JS fun.

I’ve had great opportunities of working with great people and organizations such as the University of Southern California, Sears, Harpo Studios (Oprah), Hewitt, Leapfrog Online and many other smaller yet equally challenging groups.

## Experiences

I am always looking for a challenge and learning new technologies and methods.  There is no such thing as a set of rules but rather a dynamic of practices that is constantly evolving.
